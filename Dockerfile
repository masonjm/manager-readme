# Working With James

If I sent this to you, we're probably starting to work together. Hello! 
I'm super excited to learn more about you and to define our professional 
relationship together.

This is my operating manual. Use it to learn how I (ideally) work, how 
to maximize my utility to you, and how to debug me when something breaks.

## It is my job to:

1. Help you be more awesome.

   I care about you as a person first, a team mate second, and an employee a distant last. I
   believe you have unique stengths, and that you will be happiest and most productive in a
   position where you can use and grow those strengths. You might not be in that position now;
   we can change that. That position might not exist; we can change that too. 

   I want to know what you're best at. I want you to know what you most enjoy doing. I will
   do whatever I can to maximize the time you spend doing those things. We'll talk about this
   a lot during 1 on 1 meetings.

2. Create shared context.

   I expect you to make your own decisions. To make good decisions, you need context. Because we
   function as a team, yet we all make our own decisions, it is vital that we share a context as
   much as possible.

   I do my best to find differings context and unify them. This might be communicating
   strategy from senior leadership, or simply telling two people they need to talk to
   each other.

## How I Communicate

Strong beliefs, weakly held

Think out loud. Process verbally. I will try to make "you should do this" statements explicit,
so don't leave a "processing ideas" conversation thinking you have marching orders.

I have a lot of ideas. Some of them are even good ideas. I often want help figuring out which
are the ideas worth keeping. Push back when I suggest things. Ask questions. Help me refine
the idea and ensure I'm not missing something important.

I prefer to give suggestions rather than dictate choices. I will try to make constraints and
goals explicit, but leave the details up to you. I will sometimes make suggestions on the
details based on my experience. They are just suggestions.

Think in systems. Long term usually more important than short term.

## How I Work

It's OK to fail. It's more than OK; it's expected. If you aren't regularly failing, you aren't
aiming high enough. That said, you also need successes. At least occasionally.

It's important to know how resilient any given situation is to failure. I like the "Ready, Fire,
Aim" metaphor. Ready, Fire, Aim is usually a faster way to hit your target than Ready, Aim, Fire;
but you end up shooting more bullets and hitting more things that aren't your target. Check down
range first. Are you going to hit anything sensitive? Do you have enough bullets to spend them
freely? Most of the time, you're fine to start shooting and adjusting your aim.

## Some Quirks

Ask me for help, don't tell me what to do. It's a much better way to engage me. I have a
pathological need to help other people, and I respond very poorly to being told what to do.

I need context before I can start. I'm great at listening and at asking questions to get that
context. If you can't provide enough context, expect the questions. Make sure you leave enough
time for that. I won't be able to help until I understand the scope of the problem I'm trying
to solve.

I'm not confrontational. I'm working on this. Pay attention when I tell you something might be
a bad idea. It's the closest I'll usually come to saying "stop, you're making a mistake." This
is especially important if you're my boss.

I'm horrible at micromanaging. I'm competent at keeping my own todo list straight, but that's
my limit. Don't expect me to keep track of your work for you. I *will* put systems in place to
ensure you're accountable to your team, and that you're clear on what you should be working on
next.

I believe in transparency, openness, and honesty. I love answering questions almost as much as
I love asking them. That said, I'm not great at pushing information everywhere it needs to go.
I'm working on this, too. Please ask questions. Let me know when something is unclear.

Relationship philosophy

How to ask questions

1 on 1s. Duration. Agenda. Scheduling.

Feedback (in the moment). Stoplight. Performance Conversations.



Trust

Work/life balance

People > Process. Own your work. You build it you run it. Remove impediments. Make decisions; get feedback.



Focus on strengths

Clean as you go

Optimize for happiness. This increases velocity.

Give grace

Make it better

Minutia: I turn my light one when I'm in my office, and off when I leave. I close my door when I'm gone for the day.





Make things concrete. Small experiments done quickly. "Fail fast".

Ready. Fire. Aim.

Ask me, don't tell me.

Constantly learning, often aimlessly

Code that doesn't get deployed and add value is a waste

We work with smart people. We treat them that way.

Ask for help. Help others.
