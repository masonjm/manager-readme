# Working With James

If I sent this to you, we're probably starting to work together. Hello! 
I'm super excited to learn more about you and to define our professional 
relationship together.

This is my operating manual. Use it to learn how I (ideally) work, how 
to maximize my utility to you, and how to debug me when something breaks.

## It is my job to:

1. Help you be more awesome.

   I care about you as a person first, a team mate second, and an employee a distant last. I
   believe you have unique stengths, and that you will be happiest and most productive in a
   position where you can use and grow those strengths. You might not be in that position now;
   we can change that. That position might not exist; we can change that too. 

   I want to know what you're best at. I want you to know what you most enjoy doing. I will
   do whatever I can to maximize the time you spend doing those things. We'll talk about this
   a lot during 1 on 1 meetings.

2. Create shared context.

   I expect you to make your own decisions. To make good decisions, you need context. Because we
   function as a team, yet we all make our own decisions, it is vital that we share a context as
   much as possible.

   I do my best to find differings context and unify them. This might be communicating
   strategy from senior leadership, or simply telling two people they need to talk to
   each other.

## How I communicate

Humor

Strong beliefs, weakly held

Think out loud

Think in systems. Long term usually more important than short term.

## James, as a coworker

## James, as a boss

## James, as an employee



Relationship philosophy

How to ask questions

1 on 1s. Duration. Agenda. Scheduling.

Feedback (in the moment). Stoplight. Performance Conversations.



Trust

Work/life balance

People > Process. Own your work. You build it you run it. Remove impediments. Make decisions; get feedback.



Focus on strengths

Clean as you go

Optimize for happiness. This increases velocity.

Give grace

Make it better

Minutia: I turn my light one when I'm in my office, and off when I leave. I close my door when I'm gone for the day.





Make things concrete. Small experiments done quickly. "Fail fast".

Ready. Fire. Aim.

Ask me, don't tell me.

Constantly learning, often aimlessly

Code that doesn't get deployed and add value is a waste

We work with smart people. We treat them that way.

Ask for help. Help others.
